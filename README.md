# HelloAudioWorklet

[GoogleChromeLabs](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/tree/master/audio-worklet) did a fabulous work of providing us developers with sample tutorials for playing with AudioWorklets.
But I felt there was too much of clutter to start off on prototyping. The intent of this repo is to provide a clutterless playground to kick start the prototyping of any work related to audio worklets.

## Getting Started

Cloning the repo and opening the index.html won't work in Chrome or Firefox because of the security exceptions.
Hence, go to the path of the repo on terminal and start a simple http server there.

```
Linux:

python -m SimpleHttpServer

Open chrome/firefox and type in http://localhost:8000/index.html
```
